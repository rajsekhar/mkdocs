My research interests are broadly in the fields of Machine Learning with applications to Cyber Security, Digital and Mobile Forensics, Network Centric Warfare and Assured Communications. I am also interested in Cyber Law (Privacy and Security), Adversarial Machine Learning, Radio Frequency Machine Learning, real world problems in Computational Geometry, Graph Theory and Optimization. Most of my work has applications in law enforcement or Military. More recently I have recently started working with Quantum Computation and Communication with specific interests in post quantum crypto and quantum machine learning with focus on classical-quantum interaction for obtaining real world speedups. My work has been funded through awards from several federal agencies and has been featured many times in state media both electronic and print. I received the UAH college of science Research Excellence Award in Spring 2022. In the past I have received multiple awards for teaching and academic excellence from Florida State University and University of Kalyani.
