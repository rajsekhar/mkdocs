* I do not respond to phone calls from unknown numbers.
* I do not accept unsolicited snail mails either.
* Please email before telephoning or physically shipping anything!
* I will NOT fund anyone who has not taken a class with me and made an A in the class.
* Preference will be given to US citizens for all defense related work.
(August 2022) I am not looking for any new students now. So please do not send me emails. Getting an RA position is hard, one simply cannot send an email and expect to get one. So please do not bother.
