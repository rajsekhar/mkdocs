I am also interested in Cyber Law (Privacy and Security), Adversarial Machine Learning, Radio Frequency Machine Learning, real world problems in Computational Geometry, Graph Theory and Optimization. Most of my work has applications in law enforcement or Military. More recently I have recently started working with Quantum Computation and Communication with specific interests in post quantum crypto and quantum machine learning with focus on classical-quantum interaction for obtaining real world speedups. My work has been funded through awards from several federal agencies and has been featured many times in state media both electronic and print. I received the UAH college of science Research Excellence Award in Spring 2022. In the past I have received multiple awards for teaching and academic excellence from Florida State University and University of Kalyani.  </p>"},{"location":"academicMemberships/","title":"Academic Memberships","text":"<ul> <li>Fellow, Royal Statistical Society</li> <li>Professional Member The American Society of Digital Forensics &amp; eDiscovery</li> <li>Professional Member IEEE</li> <li>Professional Member ACM</li> <li>Professional Member SIAM</li> <li>Professional Member IFIP Working Group on Digital Forensics</li> <li>Member Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society</li> <li>Member Upsilon Pi Epsilon Honor Society</li> <li>Member Golden Key International Honor Society</li> </ul>"},{"location":"contactInfo/","title":"Contact Info","text":"<ul> <li>I do not respond to phone calls from unknown numbers.</li> <li>I do not accept unsolicited snail mails either.</li> <li>Please email before telephoning or physically shipping anything!</li> <li>I will NOT fund anyone who has not taken a class with me and made an A in the class.</li> <li>Preference will be given to US citizens for all defense related work.
